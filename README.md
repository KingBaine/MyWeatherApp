This is a react Project Guys.... I did not add the node modules files because they are plenty and heavy files inside.
So you can create your own Empty react project
Enter in your Project folder from your command line interface 
   cd "Project-Folder"
   npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css"
   npm install moment --save"
